Welcome fellow Traveller. Thank you for looking into the files.

# The Local Gossip ~ Episode Template.

glyph has made a template which you can find [here](dat://b03a3e6871b919f0704f46f042523b1dd7ff7a2b9c22f28345ca7c3282f2b603/) in case you are wanting to make a site for a specific episode.

## Accessibility

We've tried to make this site as accessible for screen-readers as possible but if you can think of a way we can do better we'd love to hear from you!

## Contributors and Thanks

This site was put together by Dan Hassan who was inspired by a site which Glyph put together for Episode 0. Glyph shared the DAT link with Dan over a game of ssb-chess. It so happened that the next day Dan was speaking with Angelica and Zach for the 2 & 3 shows back-to-back like an oldschool mixed tape. He then felt the zine enthusiasm and excitment and built out this site.

Hermes, which you may have noticed sprinkled around the site like seretonin sugar (but not refined sugar, rather, freeze dried wild berries sugar - yum), is a creation from Angelica's brain. You can find them all through SSB.

Many of the words have been inspired by riffs with Zach and there are many links out to other words he has written.

## Fork

You may want to fork this site and use some of the code - or to keep your own index. That's cool! Here's how.

+ Click the Menu (three horizontal dots) to the right of the URl / address bar
+ Select 'Make editable copy'
+ Click 'Create copy'
+ Click 'Set local directory' and specify a folder for your fork (where the files of your new site will live)
+ Whoop! You now have your own copy of THE LOCAL GOSSIP INDEX episode template
